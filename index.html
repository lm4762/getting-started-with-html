  <b>What is a Web Page?</b><br>
<p>A web page is a text document written in HTML (<em>HyperText Markup Language</em>). Browers read the documents and interpret them so that they can be displayed.</p>

<p>The types of files found on the web are <em>plain text, HTML, videos and music</em>.</p>
<b>Tags and Elements</b><br>
<p>HTML documents consist of HTML <em>elements</em>. You can tell the browser what kind of element by using HTML tags. We learned about the following tags: <em>bold, emphasis, anchor image, break, paragraph, span and div</em>. Inline tages are a, span, br, img and strong. Block tags are div, p and form. </p>

<b>Computers are Stupid</b><br>
<p>Computers only understand certain language and syntax. If you don't write exactly what the computer understands it won't be able to figure out what you want to do.</p>
<b>Can't Remeber Everything?</b><br>
<p>There are too many thing to remember so, if you forget how to format your text you can just look it up.</p>
